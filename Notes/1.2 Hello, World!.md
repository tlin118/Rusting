### Creating a Project Directory
```console
$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
```

### Writing and Running a Rust Program
- Rust files always end with the *.rs* extension
- use underscore if using more than one word in filename
- ex. *hello_world.rs* rather than *helloworld.rs*

Filename: [[Projects/hello_world/main.rs|main.rs]]
```rust
// Listing 1-1: A program that prints `Hello, world!`
fn main() {
	println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

ㅤ 
-  to compile and run
```console
$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
```

---
### Anatomy of a Rust Program

```rust
fn main() {

}
```
- defines a function named main
- `main` function
	- always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program
- first line declares a function named `main` that has no parameters and returns nothing
- parameters go inside parentheses `()`
- function body is wrapped in `{}`
- Rust requires curly brackets around all function bodies
- good style to place opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration, adding one space in between

ㅤ 
```rust
	println!("Hello, world!");
```
- body of the `main` function
- indents to four spaces, not a tab
- `println!` calls a Rust macro
	- if a function was called instead, it would be entered as `println` (without the `!`)
	- using `!` means that you're calling a macro instead of a normal function
		- macros don't always follow the same rules as functions
- `"Hello, world!"` string
	- pass string as an argument to `println!`, and string is printed to the screen
- end line with semicolon `;`
	- indicates that this expression is over and next one is ready to being
	- most lines of Rust code end with a semicolon

---
### Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps
- must compile program using the Rust compiler by entering `rustc` and passing the name of source file
```console
rustc main.rs
```
- after compiling, Rust outputs a binary executable
	- *main.exe* on Windows, *main* on other platforms

ㅤ 
- run *main* or *main.exe* to execute
```console
$ ./main # or .\main.exe on Windows
```
- Rust is an *ahead-of-time compiled* language
	- can run executable without having Rust installed
